# About this project

A CLI tool (`sonar`) that integrates SonarQube Server and Cloud into developer workflows.

# Running checks

```bash
bun run lint          # ESLint (TypeScript-aware, includes import sort)
bun run lint:fix      # Auto-fix safe issues
bun run typecheck     # tsc --noEmit
bun test              # Unit tests
bun run test:all      # Unit + integration + script tests
```

# Writing code

- Always fix TypeScript errors before considering a task done.
- Never attempt to fix linting issues until the implementation is correct.
- Use `import type` for type-only imports.
- **MANDATORY**: After editing any `.ts` file, run `bun run format` to format all source files at once, or `bun x prettier --write <file>` for a single file.

## Commands

Each command lives in `src/cli/commands/`. The command tree is defined in `src/cli/command-tree.ts` and the entry point is `src/index.ts`.

To add a new command: add it to `src/cli/command-tree.ts` and implement the logic in a new file under `src/cli/commands/`.

## Error handling

Use `runCommand()` from `src/lib/run-command.ts` to wrap command handlers — it provides consistent error handling and exit codes. Never handle errors manually in command handlers.
Please use the exception types defined in `src/cli/commands/_common/error.ts` for production code. If you need to throw an error from a mock in test code, it's fine to use the generic `Error` type.

## State and auth

- Persistent state (server URL, org, project) is managed via `src/lib/state-manager.ts`.
- Tokens are stored in the system keychain via `src/lib/keychain.ts` — never store tokens in plain files.
- All path and URL constants live in `src/lib/config-constants.ts` — import from there instead of hardcoding.

## Tests

Please try to create integration tests in priority. If the test is too complicated to set up, write unit tests.
Try to get inspiration from other tests to follow the same structure.

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/` — run with `bun test`
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` — require env vars. They are using a harness to help set up tests and make assertions.
- The UI module has a built-in mock system (`src/ui/mock.ts`) — use it instead of mocking stdout directly.

## Documentation

When adding, removing, or changing commands, scripts, or project structure, update `CLAUDE.md`, and `AGENTS.md` to reflect the change before finishing.
