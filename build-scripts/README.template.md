## State Management

See [State Management](./docs/state-management.md) for more information.

## Uninstalling

### Linux/Mac OS

1. Delete the `~/.local/share/sonarqube-cli/` folder.
2. Remove `export PATH="$HOME/.local/share/sonarqube-cli/bin:$PATH"` from your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc` files.

### Windows

1. Delete the `%localappdata%\sonarqube-cli\` folder.
2. Remove this folder from the `PATH` user-level environment variable.

## Data collection

The SonarQube CLI collects anonymous usage data and error reports to help improve the product.

**Telemetry:** Anonymous command usage statistics are sent to SonarSource.

**Error reporting:** Unhandled exceptions are reported to [Sentry](https://sentry.io) to help us identify and fix crashes.

Both are enabled by default and share the same opt-out toggle. To disable all data collection:

```bash
sonar config telemetry --disabled
```

No personally identifiable information is transmitted. File paths in error reports are anonymized by replacing your home directory with `~`.

## Contributing

Please be aware that we are not actively looking for feature contributions. The truth is that it's extremely difficult for someone outside
SonarSource to comply with our roadmap and expectations. Therefore, we typically only accept minor cosmetic changes and typo fixes.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for setup instructions, coding guidelines, and how to run tests.
